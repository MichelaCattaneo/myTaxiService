\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Revision History}
		% Record all revisions to the document.
	\subsection{Purpose	and	Scope}
		% State	the	purpose	and	scope of the document.
		This document represents the Integration Test Plan Document. It aims at specifying the plan for the integration testing of myTaxiService application, ensuring that all its modules interacts properly.\\
		This document is intended for the development team, that needs to know what it is needed to test, in which sequence it should occur and with which tools.\\
		myTaxiService is an application that simplifies the access of the customers to the taxi service, managing also the taxi driver's distribution over the city and the queues of the areas. The customer can use the mobile application or the web app to request or reserve a taxi and a notification is forwarded to the designated taxi driver, who is going to answer. This system should always be responsive and reliable, in order to keep up with all the requests of the passenger and the notifications forwarding.\\ This is the reason why the components that comprise the myTaxiService system are meant to be well integrated and tested.

\section{Integration Strategy}
	\subsection{Entry Criteria}	
		These are the criteria that must be respected before the integration testing phase may begin:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Requirement Analysis and Specification Document is complete and revised
			\item Design Document is complete and revised
			\item Code Inspection Document is complete and revised
			\item The code is complete and bugs free
			\item The product satisfies the requirements and the assumptions specified in the RASD
			\item The product satisfies the architecture and the design specified in the DD
			\item Test environment, test cases and test data are ready
		\end{itemize}	
		% Specify	the	criteria	that	must	be	met	before	integration testing of specific	elements	may	begin	(e.g.,	functions	must	have	been	unit tested).
	\subsection{Elements to	be Integrated}
		%Identify	the	components	to	be	integrated,	refer	to	your design	document	to	identify	such	components	in	a	way	that	is	consistent with	your	design.
		These components refer to the ones specified in the Component View in chapter 2.3 of the DD. This diagram shows how these components have to be integrated and the order of integration, according to the strategy adopted.
	\subsection{Integration Testing Strategy}
		% Describe	the	integration testing approach (top-down,	bottom-up,functional	groupings,	etc.)	and	the	rationale for	the	choosing that approach.
		The main advantage of the Bottom-Up approach is that bugs are more easily found. With Top-Down, it is easier to find a missing branch link.
		da database a moduli client
		La parte più critica è quella piu bassa!(che contiene la logica del sistema) meglio bottom up.
		cosi evitiamo di fare gli stub ma facciamo i driver che sono più semplici.
		basic functionalities are tested at the beginning
	\subsection{Sequence of	Component/Function Integration}
		% NOTE:	 The structure	of	this	section	may	vary	depending	on	the	integration	strategy	you	select	in	Section	2.3. Use the structure proposed	below	as	a	non	mandatory	guide.

			% For	each	subsystem: Identify	the	sequence	in	which	the	software	components will	be	integrated within	the	subsystem.	Relate	this	sequence	to	any	product	features/functions	that	are	being	built	up.	
		\subsubsection{Subsystem Integration Sequence}
			The subsystems will be integrated in this order:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \textbf{Server}: According to the strategy adopted, Bottom-up, this is the first subsystem that will be integrated, because it is the lower level of our system and if this part doesn't work, the other ones can't be tested
				\item \textbf{Taxi Driver Client}: This is the second subsystem that will be integrated.
				\item \textbf{Passenger Client}: This is the last subsystem that will be integrated.
			\end{enumerate}
			% Identify	the	order	in which	subsystems	will	be	integrated. If	you	have	a	single	subsystem,	2.4.1	and	2.4.2	are	to	be	merged	in a	single	section.	You	can	refer	to	Section	2.2	of	the	test	plan example [1] as	an	example	of	what	we	expect.
