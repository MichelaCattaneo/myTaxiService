\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
		This document represents the Code Inspection document, whose main goal is to examine source code in order to discover bugs, verifying that coding conventions are respected and look for potential issues. This part is necessary to improve the quality of the code and to assure that there are no errors in it. \\
		This document is addressed to the project development teams, who need to work on code without mistakes before the production phase, in order to avoid future possible problems.
	\subsection{Document structure}
		This document is divided in five main parts:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Introduction:} this section describes the document in general and its purpose.
			\item  \textbf{Classes assigned:} this section specifies the name of the classes and methods assigned to the group.
			\item  \textbf{Functional roles:} this section shows the role of each method assigned and their functions in the class.
			\item  \textbf{Issues:} this section verifies that all the points of the code inspection checklist are respected in the classes assigned.
			\item  \textbf{Other problems:} this section deals with other possible issues found in the code, referring to the lines generating a bug and how it can create problems in the program.
		\end{itemize}
