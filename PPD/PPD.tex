\section{Task Scheduling}
	Here is presented a list of the relevant tasks of the project, with their schedule, dependencies and the time spent for each one:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{T1} RASD: this is the first task to accomplish. It describes the most important features of the project: requirements, assumptions, interfaces, model of the Database and how the myTaxiService application should work. It is necessary to redact and finish this document, identifying all the essential aspects, before it is possible to start the project.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 10 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: -}.
		\item \textbf{T2} Design Document: this document describes the architectural design of the myTaxiService system. It is also part of the documentation necessary to finish before the project starts. In facts, after the RASD has been done, it is necessary to identify the architecture and the components of the project, before actually starting to code.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 10 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T1}.
		\item \textbf{T3} Database: based on the model described in the RASD and in the Design Document, this task consists in the creation of the tables of the database.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 15 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T2}.
		\item \textbf{T4} Interfaces: based on the interfaces shown in the RASD and in the Design Document, this task contains the code implementing the interfaces on the client side.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 2 months}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T2}.
		\item \textbf{T5} Requirements: this task consists in the development of the application logic on the server side (for example the AccessManager component that manages the login and the registration or the RequestManager that manages requests,  reservations and notifications).\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 2 months}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T3}.
		\item \textbf{T6} Code Inspection: once the code part is completed, it is necessary to check that the code is bug free, also verifying that all the coding conventions are respected, in order to improve its quality and, in the meantime, to assure that there are no issues.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 1 month}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T4,T5}.
		\item \textbf{T7} Code Inspection Document: once the code inspection is done, it is necessary to document any issue found in the code.\\ \textit{Estimated time: 5 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T6}.
		\item \textbf{T8} Test Document: this task consists of the redaction of a document that explains the strategy adopted for unit testing, integration testing and system testing. This must be done after the code is completed and before the actual testing.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 10 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T6}.
		\item \textbf{T9} Unit Testing: according to what is written in the Test Document, this task involves accomplishing the unit testing.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 20 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T8}.
		\item \textbf{T10} Integration Testing: according to what is written in the Test Document, this task involves accomplishing the integration testing.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 20 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T8}.
		\item \textbf{T11} System Testing: according to what is written in the  Test Document, this task involves accomplishing the system testing.\\ \textit{Estimated time: about 20 days}.\\ \textit{Dependencies: T9,T10}.
	\end{itemize}
	The project should start on October 2015 and, according to the time estimation and the resource allocation, it should be over in about 6 months on March 2016. Comparing this assumption with the COCOMO results, that states that the project should last 9 months, the reality could reasonably be in the middle of this two estimation.\\ \\ This is a simple Gantt chart of the task schedule:\\

	Based on the schedule and the availability of our resources, the members of the team can be allocated to the tasks in this way:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{T1}: we can allocate all the resources (two people) to this task because without it we cannot start the next tasks. In fact the resources are allocated to the redaction of the RASD in order to accelerate its completion and therefore start as soon as possible the other tasks.
		\item \textbf{T2}: we allocate all the resources (two people) to the redaction of the Design Document because it is necessary to complete the architectural design before continuing with the project development.
		\item \textbf{T3}: we can allocate one person to the creation of the database after the task T2.
		\item \textbf{T4}: we can allocate one person to the development of the interfaces during the creation of the database, because this task does not need the database implementation part.
		\item \textbf{T5}: we can allocate one person to the development of the server side of the system (requirements). The person that we allocate to this task is the same that we allocated to the task 3 because this task needs a database to be developed.
		\item \textbf{T6}: once T4 and T5 are done, we allocate the two people in the team to this task because it requires a good deal of time and its duration can be reduced with two people.
		\newpage
		\item \textbf{T7}: after T6, we allocate one person to redact the Code Inspection Document.
		\item \textbf{T8}: after T6 and during T7, we can allocate the other person to write the Test Document.
		\item \textbf{T9}: after T8, we allocate one person to write unit tests.
		\item \textbf{T10}: during T9, the other person can be allocated to the integration test.
		\item \textbf{T11}: once T9 and T10 are done, we allocate all the resources for the system test.
	\end{itemize}
	% Allocate the resources (all memebers of your group) to the various tasks. In defining the allocation, take into account your actual availability for the project.
